# MyGame
Writing the code for a game made with OOP methods and using SDL2 frameworks .
The comments might be in Enlgish or Romanian , and they are meant to explain the things next to them .
Also , I added in the comment section the code that was " removed " due to changes that took place .
The project is not finished yet , I still need to place the collision layer into the map and to implement it into to code .
As it shows , the game just present the player and the map .
You can control the player with "WASD" keys . The player is everytime in the center of the screen , only if he is not moved anywhere else but the map bounds .
